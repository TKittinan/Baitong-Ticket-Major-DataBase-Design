# Event Ticketing System – Database Design

This project is a database design practice for an event ticketing system using PostgreSQL.

The main purpose of this project is to understand how to design a relational database, create tables, and manage relationships between data.

# What This Project Does

Designed an ER Diagram (using draw.io)

Planned table structure before coding

Created tables using SQL

Defined primary keys and foreign keys

Implemented basic order and ticket relationships

# Main Tables

The database includes tables such as:

Users

Events

Tickets

Orders

Order_Items

These tables are connected using foreign keys to support ticket booking flow.

# Tools Used

PostgreSQL

SQL (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT)

draw.io (for ERD design)

Excel (for planning table structure)

# What I Learned

How to design an ERD from a system idea

How to convert ERD into relational tables

Writing basic SQL queries

Understanding one-to-many relationships

Using primary and foreign keys correctly

# Note

This project focuses on database structure and learning SQL concepts.
It does not include a full application interface.
